# 👋 Hi, I'm BENZOOgataga!

I'm a student at [EFREI](https://efrei.fr/) (French School of General Digital Engineering), where I specialize in **network engineering** and infrastructure systems. Outside of school, I design and manage **production-ready servers**, game server clusters, and self-hosted platforms with automation and monitoring in mind.

- ⚙️ Visit my professional [portfolio website](https://benzoogataga.com/) for infra-related projects.
- 🌐 Visit my personal [portfolio website](https://benzoogataga.com/) for more personal, game-related creations.
- ✍️ I voluntarily don't share my LinkedIn here as it's mostly in French.
> **Note:** I'm not a software developer. My projects focus on infrastructure, bots, and systems, not code volume or GitHub scoring.

## 🛠️ Currently working on

- **[Industrium](https://industrium.net)** (formerly Flaze SMP): modded Minecraft experience with infrastructure and company systems. GitHub organization [available here](https://github.com/IndustriumMC).
- **Lyra Bot** *(in development)*: RPG-themed Discord bot by me and LyraStudio, combining lore, progression, and text-based gameplay
- **Server infrastructure upgrades**: improvements to monitoring stacks, DNS handling, and automation pipelines for both Minecraft and web projects.
- **Internal tools**: CLI and web-based utilities for managing players, companies, plots, and stats in Industrium, designed to assist staff operations and support Discord bot integration.

## 💼 What I Do

- 🖥️ Design and manage **Linux-based infrastructure** (Docker, Nginx, systemd, reverse proxies)
- 🔧 Automate everything with **Bash** and **Ansible**
- 📊 Deploy and configure **monitoring tools** like Prometheus, Grafana, and Uptime Kuma
- 🕹️ Maintain and optimize **modded and custom game servers** (Minecraft, Rust, Satisfactory...)
- 🔐 Secure and document real-world systems (e.g. AD integration on Debian at [SEMMARIS](https://www.rungisinternational.com/decouvrir/missions))

## 🧪 Highlight Projects

### Industrium Infrastructure  
Public infrastructure for a large-scale Minecraft modded server:
- Full Docker stack (servers, dashboards, backup system, monitoring)
- Remote management scripts, role-based access, and metrics
- Designed for scalability and high uptime

### `join-active-directory.yml`  
Production-ready Ansible script to integrate Debian servers into an Active Directory domain:
- Automates `realm join`, sudo group mapping, user home creation, and [LAPS4Linux](https://github.com/schorschii/LAPS4LINUX) configuration.
- Tested and used in production at [SEMMARIS](https://www.rungisinternational.com/decouvrir/missions) ([Marché de Rungis](https://www.rungisinternational.com/))
