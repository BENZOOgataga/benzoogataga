Hi, I'm BENZOOgataga, passionate about tech and creator of many projects, including my favorite, FlazeBot, where I work as a designer, developer, and community manager. I use tools like Visual Studio Code, PyCharm, and Sublime Text, and I code in Python, JavaScript, Java, HTML, and CSS. I don't call myself a developer because I want to work as a network engineer.

You can connect with me on [Twitter](https://x.com/BENZOOgataga), [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@BENZOOgataga), [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/benzoogataga_), and [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/benzoogataga/).
