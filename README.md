# 👋 Hi, I'm BENZOOgataga!

I'm a student at [EFREI](https://efrei.fr/) (French School of General Digital Engineering), where I specialize in **network engineering** and infrastructure systems. Outside of school, I design and manage **production-ready servers**, game server clusters, and self-hosted platforms with automation and monitoring in mind.

## 💼 What I Do

- 🖥️ Design and manage **Linux-based infrastructure** (Docker, Nginx, systemd, reverse proxies)
- 🔧 Automate everything with **Bash** and **Ansible**
- 📊 Deploy and configure **monitoring tools** like Prometheus, Grafana, and Uptime Kuma
- 🕹️ Maintain and optimize **modded and custom game servers** (Minecraft, Rust, Satisfactory...)
- 🔐 Secure and document real-world systems (e.g. AD integration on Debian at [SEMMARIS](https://www.rungisinternational.com/decouvrir/missions))
